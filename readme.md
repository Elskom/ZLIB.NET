# zlib.managed

[![NuGet Badge](https://buildstats.info/nuget/zlib.managed?includePreReleases=true)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/zlib.managed/)

A fork of zlib.net with a ton of fixes. Separate versioning is used though and is recommended to be used over the outdated zlib.net.

This version has Visual Studio 2017 or newer project files too.
