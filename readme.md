A fork of zlib.net with a ton of fixes and basically a complete rewrite. Separate versioning is used though and is recommended to be used over the outdated zlib.net.

This version requires Visual Studio 2019 or newer as well, or at least the .NET 6 SDK or newer.
JetBrains Rider can also be used as well if that is the preferred IDE to open with.

Based on zlib.net and zlib-1.1.3, so credits should go to the authors
[Jean-loup Gailly](jloup@gzip.org) and [Mark Adler](madler@alumni.caltech.edu)
and contributors of the native zlib written in C, credits should also go to
ComponentAce for the original zlib.net (which went unmaintained).
