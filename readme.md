A fork of zlib.net with a ton of fixes. Separate versioning is used though and is recommended to be used over the outdated zlib.net.

This version requires Visual Studio 2019 or newer as well, or at least the .NET 6 SDK or newer.
JetBrains Rider can also be used as well if that is the prefered IDE to open with.
